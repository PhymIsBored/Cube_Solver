# Arduino Notation

Alle Bewegungen werden aus der Sicht der Hand gesehen

Table: 
y is the same as Cube y
y' 
y2


Hand (rename):
x is the same as Cube x'


Arduino rotation:

table:
	1 quarter turn // attention this needs to be like y' clear
	2 half turn clear
	3 negative quarter turn not really clear but whatever
	
	// quarter turn without hand // like y
	// half turn without hand
	// negative quarter turn without hand
	
hand:
	4 open
	5 close
	6 rotate cube

Problems:
1. find a way to reset the position of the motor. Currently the rotation works, but it is offset at the beginning and it keeps that offset. This offset needs to be reset.
2.
